 **My Angular project for the Data Representation module.**



To launch the project, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/nuer228/Angular-Project.git
```


After you've cloned the repository, launch the client and the server in the command prompt. All the angular dependencies are already part of the project so you won't need any additional installs.

```
ng serve
node server.js
```

This is the main home page that opens up. It uses a navigation bar on the left of the page and also a News API which uploads news articles live.

You can also change the provider of the news by clicking on the side menu of the News Headlines. This is what it looks like:

For my READ I made a list of countries and put them into a table. You can UPDATE and DELETE from here. This is what it looks like:

You can also CREATE a new country or edit a current one.

Finally, I have the contact page which uses a Stepper material from Angular materials.
