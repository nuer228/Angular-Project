**My Angular project for the Data Representation module.**



To launch the project, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/nuer228/Angular-Project.git
```


After you've cloned the repository, launch the client and the server in the command prompt. All the angular dependencies are already a part of the project so you won't need any additional installs.

```
ng serve
node server.js
```

This is the main home page that opens up. It uses a navigation bar on the left of the page and also a News API which uploads news articles live.
